                            Zoe craved a more authentic way to connect with potential matches. Surprisingly, she discovered a lack of in-person speed dating events in her area. 
                            Determined to fill this gap, Zoe took matters into her own hands, and thus, Sips and Sparks was born!

As a lifelong Connecticut resident, I'm delighted that something so fun and engaging has come to our state. I believe everyone has someone out there waiting for them, and that's why I love the excitement and spontaneity of speed dating! It's a vibrant way for people to meet and connect. When I'm not hosting events, you'll find me exploring new restaurants, discovering the best happy hours, or traveling with my husband. Whether it's trying out a new culinary spot or planning our next adventure, I'm always up for a new and exciting experience!

                            Hey there, I'm Tiffany and I am so excited to be hosting events for Sips and Sparks! I've used the dating apps for years and that first date is, always, when I know whether I want to see that person again. So, why not skip that initial texting stage and see if we vibe right away? Speed dating gives us the ability to meet so many interesting people in a single night and you get to forge personal connections right away! When I'm not hosting you'll find me climbing (real and plastic) rocks, riding my motorcycle, hiking, going to see live music, or cozied up with a good book and my pets. I love that Sips and Sparks gets me out and socializing and I hope to see you at the next event!
